	<h2>What is this?</h2>
	<p><strong>Slideborg</strong> is designed for presenters and has a couple use cases:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p>Say you're at an unconference and you're short a projector, but most everyone has their own laptop or tablet. Share a <strong>Slideborg</strong> url with your audience, and they can view your slide deck while you control it from your own device.</p></li>
		<li><p>This time you're at a conference that has a projector, but you don't want to stand at your laptop to control it. A remote would sure be handy, but you don't have one :( Just load up a <strong>Slideborg</strong> url on your laptop, and control it via your phone or tablet.</p></li>
	</ul>
	<p>There are other possibilities as well! Imagine putting on a remote presentation where no one is in the same location. We hope you enjoy!</p>
